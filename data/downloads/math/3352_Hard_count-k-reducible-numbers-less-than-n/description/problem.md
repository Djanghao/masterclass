## Description

You are given a **binary** string `s` representing a number `n` in its binary form.

You are also given an integer `k`.

An integer `x` is called **k-reducible** if performing the following operation **at most** `k` times reduces it to 1:

	- Replace `x` with the **count** of set bits in its binary representation.

For example, the binary representation of 6 is `"110"`. Applying the operation once reduces it to 2 (since `"110"` has two set bits). Applying the operation again to 2 (binary `"10"`) reduces it to 1 (since `"10"` has one set bit).

Return an integer denoting the number of positive integers **less** than `n` that are **k-reducible**.

Since the answer may be too large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "111", k = 1

**Output:** 3

**Explanation: **

`n = 7`. The 1-reducible integers less than 7 are 1, 2, and 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "1000", k = 2

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:**

`n = 8`. The 2-reducible integers less than 8 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "1", k = 3

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

There are no positive integers less than `n = 1`, so the answer is 0.

 

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= s.length <= 800`

	- `s` has no leading zeros.

	- `s` consists only of the characters `'0'` and `'1'`.

	- `1 <= k <= 5`
