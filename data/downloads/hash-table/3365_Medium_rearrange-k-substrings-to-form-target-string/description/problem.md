## Description

You are given two strings `s` and `t`, both of which are anagrams of each other, and an integer `k`.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to split the string `s` into `k` equal-sized substrings, rearrange the substrings, and concatenate them in *any order* to create a new string that matches the given string `t`.

Return `true` if this is possible, otherwise, return `false`.

An **anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once.

A **substring** is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "abcd", t = "cdab", k = 2

**Output:** true

**Explanation:**

	- Split `s` into 2 substrings of length 2: `["ab", "cd"]`.

	- Rearranging these substrings as `["cd", "ab"]`, and then concatenating them results in `"cdab"`, which matches `t`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "aabbcc", t = "bbaacc", k = 3

**Output:** true

**Explanation:**

	- Split `s` into 3 substrings of length 2: `["aa", "bb", "cc"]`.

	- Rearranging these substrings as `["bb", "aa", "cc"]`, and then concatenating them results in `"bbaacc"`, which matches `t`.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "aabbcc", t = "bbaacc", k = 2

**Output:** false

**Explanation:**

	- Split `s` into 2 substrings of length 3: `["aab", "bcc"]`.

	- These substrings cannot be rearranged to form `t = "bbaacc"`, so the output is `false`.

 

**Constraints:**

	- `1  `s` and `t` are anagrams of each other.
