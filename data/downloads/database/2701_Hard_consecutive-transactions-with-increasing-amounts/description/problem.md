## Description

Table: `Transactions`

```

+------------------+------+
| Column Name      | Type |
+------------------+------+
| transaction_id   | int  |
| customer_id      | int  |
| transaction_date | date |
| amount           | int  |
+------------------+------+
transaction_id is the primary key of this table. 
Each row contains information about transactions that includes unique (customer_id, transaction_date) along with the corresponding customer_id and amount.  

```

Write an SQL query to find the customers who have made consecutive transactions with increasing `amount` for at least three consecutive days. Include the `customer_id`, start date of the consecutive transactions period and the end date of the consecutive transactions period. There can be multiple consecutive transactions by a customer.

Return *the result table ordered by* `customer_id, consecutive_start, consecutive_end` *in **ascending** order.*

The query result format is in the following example.

 

**Example 1:**

```

Transactions table:
+----------------+-------------+------------------+--------+
| transaction_id | customer_id | transaction_date | amount |

Output:&nbsp;
+-------------+-------------------+-----------------+
| customer_id | consecutive_start | consecutive_end |&nbsp;
+-------------+-------------------+-----------------+
| 101 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp; 2023-05-01 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |&nbsp;2023-05-03 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp;

+-------------+-------------------+-----------------+
Explanation:&nbsp;
- customer_id 101 has made consecutive transactions with increasing amounts from May 1st, 2023, to May 3rd, 2023
- customer_id 102 does not have any consecutive transactions for at least 3 days.&nbsp;
- customer_id 105 has two sets of consecutive transactions: from May 1st, 2023, to May 4th, 2023, and from May 12th, 2023, to May 14th, 2023.&nbsp;
customer_id is sorted in ascending order.
