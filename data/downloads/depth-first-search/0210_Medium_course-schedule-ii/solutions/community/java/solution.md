This question asks for an order in which prerequisite courses must be taken first. This prerequisite relationship reminds one of directed graphs. Then, the problem reduces to find a topological sort order of the courses, which would be a DAG if it has a valid order.

    public int[] findOrder(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
        int[] incLinkCounts = new int[numCourses];
        List<List<Integer>> adjs = new ArrayList<>(numCourses);
        initialiseGraph(incLinkCounts, adjs, prerequisites);
        //return solveByBFS(incLinkCounts, adjs);
        return solveByDFS(adjs);
    }

The first step is to transform it into a directed graph. Since it is likely to be sparse,we use adjacency list graph data structure. 1 -> 2 means 1 must be taken before 2.

    private void initialiseGraph(int[] incLinkCounts, List<List<Integer>> adjs, int[][] prerequisites){
        int n = incLinkCounts.length;
        while (n-- > 0) adjs.add(new ArrayList<>());
        for (int[] edge : prerequisites) {
            incLinkCounts[edge[0]]++;
            adjs.get(edge[1]).add(edge[0]);
        }
    }

How can we obtain a topological sort order of a DAG?

We observe that if a node has incoming edges, it has prerequisites. Therefore, the first few in the order must be those with no prerequisites, i.e. no incoming edges. Any non-empty DAG must have at least one node without incoming links. You can draw a small graph to convince yourself. If we visit these few and remove all edges attached to them, we are left with a smaller DAG, which is the same problem. This will then give our BFS solution.

    private int[] solveByBFS(int[] incLinkCounts, List<List<Integer>> adjs){
        int[] order = new int[incLinkCounts.length];
        Queue<Integer> toVisit = new ArrayDeque<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < incLinkCounts.length; i++) {
            if (incLinkCounts[i] == 0) toVisit.offer(i);
        }
        int visited = 0;
        while (!toVisit.isEmpty()) {
            int from = toVisit.poll();
            order[visited++] = from;
            for (int to : adjs.get(from)) {
                incLinkCounts[to]--;
                if (incLinkCounts[to] == 0) toVisit.offer(to);
            }
        }
        return visited == incLinkCounts.length ? order : new int[0]; 
    }

Another way to think about it is the last few in the order must be those which are not prerequisites of other courses. Thinking it recursively means if one node has unvisited child node, you should visit them first before you put this node down in the final order array. This sounds like the post-order of a DFS. Since we are putting nodes down in the reverse order, we should reverse it back to correct ordering or use a stack.

    private int[] solveByDFS(List<List<Integer>> adjs) {
        BitSet hasCycle = new BitSet(1);
        BitSet visited = new BitSet(adjs.size());
        BitSet onStack = new BitSet(adjs.size());
        Deque<Integer> order = new ArrayDeque<>();
        for (int i = adjs.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (visited.get(i) == false && hasOrder(i, adjs, visited, onStack, order) == false) return new int[0];
        }
        int[] orderArray = new int[adjs.size()];
        for (int i = 0; !order.isEmpty(); i++) orderArray[i] = order.pop();
        return orderArray;
    }
    
    private boolean hasOrder(int from, List<List<Integer>> adjs, BitSet visited, BitSet onStack, Deque<Integer> order) {
        visited.set(from);
        onStack.set(from);
        for (int to : adjs.get(from)) {
            if (visited.get(to) == false) {
                if (hasOrder(to, adjs, visited, onStack, order) == false) return false;
            } else if (onStack.get(to) == true) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        onStack.clear(from);
        order.push(from);
        return true;
    }
