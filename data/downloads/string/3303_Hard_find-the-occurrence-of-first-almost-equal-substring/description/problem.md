## Description

You are given two strings `s` and `pattern`.

A string `x` is called **almost equal** to `y` if you can change **at most** one character in `x` to make it *identical* to `y`.

Return the **smallest** *starting index* of a substring in `s` that is **almost equal** to `pattern`. If no such index exists, return `-1`.

A **substring** is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "abcdefg", pattern = "bcdffg"

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

The substring `s[1..6] == "bcdefg"` can be converted to `"bcdffg"` by changing `s[4]` to `"f"`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "ababbababa", pattern = "bacaba"

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

The substring `s[4..9] == "bababa"` can be converted to `"bacaba"` by changing `s[6]` to `"c"`.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "abcd", pattern = "dba"

**Output:** -1

**Example 4:**

**Input:** s = "dde", pattern = "d"

**Output:** 0

 

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= pattern.length < s.length <= 10^5`

	- `s` and `pattern` consist only of lowercase English letters.

 

**Follow-up:** Could you solve the problem if **at most** `k` **consecutive** characters can be changed?
