## Description

You have two fruit baskets containing `n` fruits each. You are given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `basket1` and `basket2` representing the cost of fruit in each basket. You want to make both baskets **equal**. To do so, you can use the following operation as many times as you want:

	- Choose two indices `i` and `j`, and swap the `i^th` fruit of `basket1` with the `j^th` fruit of `basket2`.

	- The cost of the swap is `min(basket1[i], basket2[j])`.

Two baskets are considered equal if sorting them according to the fruit cost makes them exactly the same baskets.

Return *the minimum cost to make both the baskets equal or *`-1`* if impossible.*

 

**Example 1:**

```

Input: basket1 = [4,2,2,2], basket2 = [1,4,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: Swap index 1 of basket1 with index 0 of basket2, which has cost 1. Now basket1 = [4,1,2,2] and basket2 = [2,4,1,2]. Rearranging both the arrays makes them equal.

```

**Example 2:**

```

Input: basket1 = [2,3,4,1], basket2 = [3,2,5,1]
Output: -1
Explanation: It can be shown that it is impossible to make both the baskets equal.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	- `basket1.length == basket2.length`

	- `1 <= basket1.length <= 10^5`

	- `1 <= basket1[i], basket2[i] <= 10^9`
