## Description

You are given an integer array `banned` and two integers `n` and `maxSum`. You are choosing some number of integers following the below rules:

	- The chosen integers have to be in the range `[1, n]`.

	- Each integer can be chosen **at most once**.

	- The chosen integers should not be in the array `banned`.

	- The sum of the chosen integers should not exceed `maxSum`.

Return *the **maximum** number of integers you can choose following the mentioned rules*.

 

**Example 1:**

```

Input: banned = [1,6,5], n = 5, maxSum = 6
Output: 2
Explanation: You can choose the integers 2 and 4.
2 and 4 are from the range [1, 5], both did not appear in banned, and their sum is 6, which did not exceed maxSum.

```

**Example 2:**

```

Input: banned = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], n = 8, maxSum = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: You cannot choose any integer while following the mentioned conditions.

```

**Example 3:**

```

Input: banned = [11], n = 7, maxSum = 50
Output: 7
Explanation: You can choose the integers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
They are from the range [1, 7], all did not appear in banned, and their sum is 28, which did not exceed maxSum.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= banned.length <= 10^4`

	- `1 <= banned[i], n <= 10^4`

	- `1 <= maxSum <= 10^9`
