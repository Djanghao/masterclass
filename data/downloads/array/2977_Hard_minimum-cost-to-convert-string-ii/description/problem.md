## Description

You are given two **0-indexed** strings `source` and `target`, both of length `n` and consisting of **lowercase** English characters. You are also given two **0-indexed** string arrays `original` and `changed`, and an integer array `cost`, where `cost[i]` represents the cost of converting the string `original[i]` to the string `changed[i]`.

You start with the string `source`. In one operation, you can pick a **substring** `x` from the string, and change it to `y` at a cost of `z` **if** there exists **any** index `j` such that `cost[j] == z`, `original[j] == x`, and `changed[j] == y`. You are allowed to do **any** number of operations, but any pair of operations must satisfy **either** of these two conditions:

	- The substrings picked in the operations are `source[a..b]` and `source[c..d]` with either `b < c` **or** `d < a`. In other words, the indices picked in both operations are **disjoint**.

	- The substrings picked in the operations are `source[a..b]` and `source[c..d]` with `a == c` **and** `b == d`. In other words, the indices picked in both operations are **identical**.

Return *the **minimum** cost to convert the string *`source`* to the string *`target`* using **any** number of operations*. *If it is impossible to convert* `source` *to* `target`,* return* `-1`.

**Note** that there may exist indices `i`, `j` such that `original[j] == original[i]` and `changed[j] == changed[i]`.

 

**Example 1:**

```

Input: source = &quot;abcd&quot;, target = &quot;acbe&quot;, original = [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;,&quot;c&quot;,&quot;e&quot;,&quot;d&quot;], changed = [&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;e&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;e&quot;], cost = [2,5,5,1,2,20]
Output: 28
Explanation: To convert &quot;abcd&quot; to &quot;acbe&quot;, do the following operations:
- Change substring source[1..1] from &quot;b&quot; to &quot;c&quot; at a cost of 5.
- Change substring source[2..2] from &quot;c&quot; to &quot;e&quot; at a cost of 1.
- Change substring source[2..2] from &quot;e&quot; to &quot;b&quot; at a cost of 2.
- Change substring source[3..3] from &quot;d&quot; to &quot;e&quot; at a cost of 20.
The total cost incurred is 5 + 1 + 2 + 20 = 28. 
It can be shown that this is the minimum possible cost.

```

**Example 2:**

```

Input: source = &quot;abcdefgh&quot;, target = &quot;acdeeghh&quot;, original = [&quot;bcd&quot;,&quot;fgh&quot;,&quot;thh&quot;], changed = [&quot;cde&quot;,&quot;thh&quot;,&quot;ghh&quot;], cost = [1,3,5]
Output: 9
Explanation: To convert &quot;abcdefgh&quot; to &quot;acdeeghh&quot;, do the following operations:
- Change substring source[1..3] from &quot;bcd&quot; to &quot;cde&quot; at a cost of 1.
- Change substring source[5..7] from &quot;fgh&quot; to &quot;thh&quot; at a cost of 3. We can do this operation because indices [5,7] are disjoint with indices picked in the first operation.
- Change substring source[5..7] from &quot;thh&quot; to &quot;ghh&quot; at a cost of 5. We can do this operation because indices [5,7] are disjoint with indices picked in the first operation, and identical with indices picked in the second operation.
The total cost incurred is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9.
It can be shown that this is the minimum possible cost.

```

**Example 3:**

```

Input: source = &quot;abcdefgh&quot;, target = &quot;addddddd&quot;, original = [&quot;bcd&quot;,&quot;defgh&quot;], changed = [&quot;ddd&quot;,&quot;ddddd&quot;], cost = [100,1578]
Output: -1
Explanation: It is impossible to convert &quot;abcdefgh&quot; to &quot;addddddd&quot;.
If you select substring source[1..3] as the first operation to change &quot;abcdefgh&quot; to &quot;adddefgh&quot;, you cannot select substring source[3..7] as the second operation because it has a common index, 3, with the first operation.
If you select substring source[3..7] as the first operation to change &quot;abcdefgh&quot; to &quot;abcddddd&quot;, you cannot select substring source[1..3] as the second operation because it has a common index, 3, with the first operation.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= source.length == target.length <= 1000`

	- `source`, `target` consist only of lowercase English characters.

	- `1 <= cost.length == original.length == changed.length <= 100`

	- `1 <= original[i].length == changed[i].length <= source.length`

	- `original[i]`, `changed[i]` consist only of lowercase English characters.

	- `original[i] != changed[i]`

	- `1 <= cost[i] <= 10^6`
