## Description

There is a computer that can run an unlimited number of tasks **at the same time**. You are given a 2D integer array `tasks` where `tasks[i] = [start_i, end_i, duration_i]` indicates that the `i^th` task should run for a total of `duration_i` seconds (not necessarily continuous) within the **inclusive** time range `[start_i, end_i]`.

You may turn on the computer only when it needs to run a task. You can also turn it off if it is idle.

Return *the minimum time during which the computer should be turned on to complete all tasks*.

 

**Example 1:**

```

Input: tasks = [[2,3,1],[4,5,1],[1,5,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
- The first task can be run in the inclusive time range [2, 2].
- The second task can be run in the inclusive time range [5, 5].
- The third task can be run in the two inclusive time ranges [2, 2] and [5, 5].
The computer will be on for a total of 2 seconds.

```

**Example 2:**

```

Input: tasks = [[1,3,2],[2,5,3],[5,6,2]]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
- The first task can be run in the inclusive time range [2, 3].
- The second task can be run in the inclusive time ranges [2, 3] and [5, 5].
- The third task can be run in the two inclusive time range [5, 6].
The computer will be on for a total of 4 seconds.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= tasks.length <= 2000`

	- `tasks[i].length == 3`

	- `1 <= start_i, end_i <= 2000`

	- `1 <= duration_i <= end_i - start_i + 1 `
