## Description

Given an integer array `queries` and a **positive** integer `intLength`, return *an array* `answer` *where* `answer[i]` *is either the *`queries[i]^th` *smallest **positive palindrome** of length* `intLength` *or* `-1`* if no such palindrome exists*.

A **palindrome** is a number that reads the same backwards and forwards. Palindromes cannot have leading zeros.

 

**Example 1:**

```

Input: queries = [1,2,3,4,5,90], intLength = 3
Output: [101,111,121,131,141,999]
Explanation:
The first few palindromes of length 3 are:
101, 111, 121, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 181, 191, 202, ...
The 90th palindrome of length 3 is 999.

```

**Example 2:**

```

Input: queries = [2,4,6], intLength = 4
Output: [1111,1331,1551]
Explanation:
The first six palindromes of length 4 are:
1001, 1111, 1221, 1331, 1441, and 1551.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= queries.length <= 5 * 10^4`

	- `1 <= queries[i] <= 10^9`

	- `1 <= intLength <= 15`
