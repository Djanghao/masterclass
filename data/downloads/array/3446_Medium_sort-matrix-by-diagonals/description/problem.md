## Description

You are given an `n x n` square matrix of integers `grid`. Return the matrix such that:

	- The diagonals in the **bottom-left triangle** (including the middle diagonal) are sorted in **non-increasing order**.

	- The diagonals in the **top-right triangle** are sorted in **non-decreasing order**.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = [[1,7,3],[9,8,2],[4,5,6]]

**Output:** [[8,2,3],[9,6,7],[4,5,1]]

**Explanation:**

![image](./images/0.png)

The diagonals with a black arrow (bottom-left triangle) should be sorted in non-increasing order:

	- `[1, 8, 6]` becomes `[8, 6, 1]`.

	- `[9, 5]` and `[4]` remain unchanged.

The diagonals with a blue arrow (top-right triangle) should be sorted in non-decreasing order:

	- `[7, 2]` becomes `[2, 7]`.

	- `[3]` remains unchanged.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = [[0,1],[1,2]]

**Output:** [[2,1],[1,0]]

**Explanation:**

![image](./images/1.png)

The diagonals with a black arrow must be non-increasing, so `[0, 2]` is changed to `[2, 0]`. The other diagonals are already in the correct order.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** grid = [[1]]

**Output:** [[1]]

**Explanation:**

Diagonals with exactly one element are already in order, so no changes are needed.

 

**Constraints:**

	- `grid.length == grid[i].length == n`

	- `1 <= n <= 10`

	- `-10^5 <= grid[i][j] <= 10^5`
